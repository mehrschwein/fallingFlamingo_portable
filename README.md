# falling flamingo
the portable windows version of the falling flamingo game

This flamingo seems a bit *unstable*.
Try to stay upright for as long as possible.

Use the slider to balance.
Switch legs from time to time to not fall down by clicking on the L and R buttons.
Click on the fishes so your food bar doesn't go down too far. You don't want to starve, right :) ?
And don't forget your toilet breaks from time to time.

have fun!
